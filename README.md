## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Charles!

Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergraduate at Louisiana State University (â€™27) with a concentration in Software Engineering and a growing focus on AI engineering. I was selected as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech (2025â€“2026), where Iâ€™m advancing my skills in machine learning through coursework, experiential projects, and industry collaboration. I'm actively building a portfolio of projects in ML/AI and am seeking opportunities to apply these skills through an internship.


### ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: [Generating Structured Data with LLMs for ASAPP](https://github.com/Samay30/ASAPP-Fall-AI-Studio-Project)
My team and I are using free-text conversation data to extract structured metadata for downstream analysis in customer contact center solutions.

- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Mistral API, Prompt Engineering, Jupyter Notebooks
- **What We Are Doing**: Designing and testing prompts to extract entities and metadata (customer intent, product references, resolution outcomes) from raw text conversations.
- **Current Status**: Early development phase â€” actively experimenting with prompt strategies and evaluation methods.


### ðŸš€ More Projects:
[Predicting Perceptions of Freedom](https://github.com/Charles-Francisco/BreakThroughTech-ML-Capstone)
   - **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
   - **What I Did**: Applied ML regression techniques on the 2018 World Happiness Report dataset to predict citizensâ€™ perceived freedom of choice globally. Performed data preprocessing, model evaluation (RÂ², RMSE), and feature importance analysis.
   - **Results**: Identified key factors influencing perceived freedom and improved predictive accuracy beyond the baseline model.
  
     
### ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code,
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
